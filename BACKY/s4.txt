INTERNSHIP POLICY
Placement Committee has put a blanket ban on Internships for 3rd year B.Tech
students in November 2011. Placement Department is neither initiates nor
conduct inside or outside campus or online recruitments for Internship for UG
3rd year students etc., but students are allowed on their sole discretion to
attend the internship off campus. But if they get PPO, they will not be allowed
to sit for December Placements.
Internships will be allowed for M.Tech VLSI, M.Tech CASE MS By Research (Upon
Research guide consent) for 5 to 6 months from Jan to July every year.
After Internship the organization has to issue the letter of Completion of
Internship with credits to the HOD of the Department.
The organization has to inform the “Employment Conversion status” to the
placement head by April first week of every year (up on completion of 3
months period).
Those who fail to get the employment conversion are eligible to attend for
other campus drives on campus.
Continuing in the organization as FTE after Internship is purely based on the
discretion of the students.
If any company assures the Employment upfront, the students are allowed to
do the internship in the same organization for having an exposure to the
technologies and the people.
